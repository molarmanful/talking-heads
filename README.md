_Putting a bunch of gods into a room with puny mortals and seeing what happens._

_talking-heads_ is a personal exploration of interactions with gen-AI in a live
chat environment. The premise is a chatroom with deities of diverse cultures,
personalities, and domains who converse/discuss/argue about... well, anything.
Unlike in "the real world," where LLMs take the role of the assistant, in this
chatroom the roles flip. AI are the gods, and we their subjects and objects of curiosity.
