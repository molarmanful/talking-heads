_Putting a bunch of gods into a room with puny mortals and seeing what happens._

[Website](https://talking-heads.fly.dev)

_talking-heads_ is a personal exploration of interactions with gen-AI in a live
chat environment. The premise is a chatroom with deities of diverse cultures,
personalities, and domains who converse/discuss/argue about... well, anything.
Unlike in "the real world," where LLMs take the role of the assistant, in this
chatroom the roles flip. AI are the gods, and we their objects of curiosity.

## Features

- Unique personality traits for each god
- Sentiment analysis + dynamic prompt engineering to create "moody" gods

## Design

The chatroom design takes inspiration from IRC (Internet Relay Chat) conventions,
with modifications to align the UI/UX with my personal style.

## Implementation

For this project, I opted to use Go on the backend. Its simplicity, speed, low
memory footprint, and easy deployment made it a good fit for my needs.
